            MeAndYouCrew is a fun, active, social clan. We like to have people of all ages in the clan,
            bringing a diverse amount of youth and age into a winning strategy (kids in this clan are
            held to the same standard of maturity as adults). Family and friends are always accepted because
            they add more fun to this game. We love to war all the time, but at the same time like to have
            players that focus on other aspects such as farming, and trophy
            pushing. We tend to get pretty serious about trying to win every war, but if we lose a war,
            we know that we tried everything we could to win.

            Our clan was originally founded by Freyja, and then turned over to Bryan due to Freyja's
            retirement. Even with a change in leadership, the clan never missed a beat and still continues
            it's previous winning ways to this day. We pride ourselves on having a strong group of core
            members who are the heart and soul of the clan, and are actively growing and learning within
            the clan. Our leadership has also proven to be fair and just to all, with the clan's best
            interest in mind at all times.

            In wars, we require that both attacks be used in every war. If players do not use both attacks
            then they are subject to being kicked from the clan. We understand if you do not want to
            participate in wars, or if real life gets in the way at times. In these cases, simply opting
            out of wars will draw no consequences in the clan, unless your base becomes inactive for a
            season.
        </p>

            Donations are a very big deal in this clan. We encourage everyone in the clan to actively
            donate. The most important when requesting in this clan is to think of how others are
            impacted by your requests. Expensive troops, such as valkyries, golems, dragons, etc, are
            not given lightly in this clan, and generally carry the requirement that they be used in war only.
            We require that everyone does not abuse other member's resources for their own gain through
            donations.
